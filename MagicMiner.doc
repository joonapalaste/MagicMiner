            Magic Miner beta-test version instructions
            ==========================================


This is a beta-test version of the game Magic Miner. This program will let you
play any level created with the level editor program "MMEditorﬂ". Here's how to
use your levels:
1) Design your levels with the editor and save them to disk.
2) Use the supplied program LevelMaker by typing "LevelMaker <file>" where
<file> is the name of your saved levelset. This will create a number of files
called Level_  0, Level_  1 and so on.
3) Load one of these files into the Magic Miner beta-test program and play it.

This program is intended for test use only. For this reason, it lacks a number
of features that will be present in the finished game. The main bit is that you
can only load one level at a time, and play it. You can't load a sequence of
levels and proceed to the next one by completing the previous one. Also, the
enemy isn't yet present, and doesn't do anything. No score is kept and no time
limit is enforced. The animation for the player character is just one block at
a time. The finished version will have smoother animation.

To play, you need a joystick. Use it to control your character. The functions of
most blocks is straightforward, but some need explanation.
  To push a brown "box", just move against it. "Boxes" will only move through
empty space. Gridwork can be used like two-dimensional ladder, but remember that
you can only get on or off it through loose ends (with red and blue markings).
Special blocks like switches and so on do not function just by standing next to
them. You have to specificly move against them. This means that if you fall on a
switch, you will not necessarily activate it.
  "Radio boxes" (with a blue cross) can be controlled with the controller
switch. Stand in the switch, depress Fire and move your joystick. Your character
will not move, but instead the selected "radio box" (outlined in grey) will
move. To switch selected "radio boxes", use the selector switch (with a small
brown "box" in it). This will automatically switch to the next "radio box".
  There are four types of teleports, divided into two colour categories: light
and dark. Light teleports require you to press Fire to activate them. Dark ones
function every time you move into them. Teleports with no markings move you to a
random location. Teleports with a small dot move you to the position you chose
for them in the editor. Teleports with a circle move you to the next circle
teleport in the level. Teleports with a big dot move you to wherever the
"crosshair" is on the level. To move the "crosshair", stand in the controller
(looks like a blue circle surrounded with grey lines), depress Fire and move
your joystick.

Menu items: "Load" loads and starts a new level. No contest checking will be
done, so use with care! "About" doesn't do anything in this version. "Quit"
quits the program.
